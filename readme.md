# Brokerage

### Description

Brokerage is a powerful platform, and a redesigned version of my [Stock Market](https://github.com/francheska-guzman/stock-market) web application. The Stock Market was my [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/apply/codebridge)' final project on March 2017, developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I decided to start the new version of my Stock Market project, Brokerage, by using AngularJS, Node.js/Express.js, PostgreSQL, CRUD, and third parties APIs, so it will be more dynamic.


### User stories

As a user, I would like to open an account in Brokerage.

As a user, I would like articles and news to keep me informed on the markets.

As a user, I want to buy and sell stocks.


As a user, I want to track changes in my Portfolio and Watchlist, and see the performance over the time.

As a user, I want to be able to add and delete stocks from my Watchlist.

As a user, I would like a green text color/up arrow for gains, and red text color/down arrow for losses.

### Challenges

1. I will be using for the first time oAuth.
2. I will be using for the first time AngularJS 2.
3. The buy and sell stocks will be a real interaction between opened accounts.
