### Description

Brokerage is a powerful platform where users can track U.S. Stock Market changes, get access to Global Business and Financial News, as well manage their own Watchlist and Portfolio.

This project is a redesigned, dynamic version of my [Stock Market](https://github.com/francheska-guzman/stock-market) web application. The Stock Market was my [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/apply/codebridge)' final project on March 2017, developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
