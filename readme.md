# Brokerage

### About the project

Brokerage is a redesigned version of my [Stock Market]('https://github.com/francheska-guzman/stock-market') web application. The Stock Market was my Per Scholas' final project on March 2017, developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I decided to start the new version of my Stock Market project, Brokerage, by using AngularJS (self-learning), Node.js/Express.js, PostgreSQL, CRUD, and third parties APIs, so it will be more dynamic.
