## <a id="about">About the project</a>

Developed by Francheska Guzman

## <a id="description">Description</a>

Brokerage is a powerful platform where users can track U.S. Stock Market changes, get access to Global Business and Financial News, as well manage their own Watchlist and Portfolio.

This project is a redesigned, dynamic version of [Stock Market](https://github.com/francheska-guzman/stock-market). The Stock Market was my [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/apply/codebridge)' final project on March 2017, developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## <a id="user-stories">User stories</a>

- As a new user, I would like to open an account in Brokerage.
- As an existing user, I would like a login/logout option.
- As a user, I would like articles and news to keep me informed on the markets.
- As a user, I want to track changes in my Portfolio and Watchlist, and see the performance over the time.
- As a user interested in trade, I want to buy and sell stocks.
- As a user, I want to be able to add and delete stocks from my Watchlist.
- As a user who wants to detect easily gains and losses, I would like a green color/up arrow for gains, and red color/down arrow for losses.
