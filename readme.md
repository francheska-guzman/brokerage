# Brokerage

### Description

Brokerage is a powerful platform, and a redesigned version of my [Stock Market](https://github.com/francheska-guzman/stock-market) web application. The Stock Market was my [Per Scholas](https://perscholas.org/apply/codebridge)' final project on March 2017, developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I decided to start the new version of my Stock Market project, Brokerage, by using the following technologies:

* AngularJS
* Charts library
* Node.js
* Express.js
* PostgreSQL
* RESTful API (CRUD)
* Third parties APIs (Global Business and Financial News, and the U.S. Stock Market Data)


### User stories

- As a user, I would like to open an account in Brokerage.
- As a user, I would like articles and news to keep me informed on the markets.
- As a user, I want to track changes in my Portfolio and Watchlist, and see the performance over the time.
- As a user, I want to buy and sell stocks.
- As a user, I want to be able to add and delete stocks from my Watchlist.
- As a user, I would like a green text color and up arrow for gains, as well a red text color and down arrow for losses.

### Challenges

- I will be using for the first time oAuth.
- I will be using for the first time AngularJS 2.
- The buy and sell stocks will be a real interaction between opened accounts.
